# Welcome to My Blog!

This blog is created for the purpose of completing ST 558 at North Carolina State University. Posts within this blog will include subject material related to becoming a data scientist, statistician, and/or how modern programming languages such as R may be leveraged to produce effective visualizations of data.

It may be transitioned to a personal website in the future!
