## First Post -- Data Scientists and Statisticians

Hello, and welcome to my blog! This blog satisfies a requirement of the course **ST 558: Data Scientists for Statisticians at North Carolina State Univeristy**.

In this post, I will be juxtaposing two popular career paths for those with degrees/training in statistics -- data scientist and statistician. More information regarding these career paths can be found at links provided below:

### Question 1: What do you think being a data scientist is about?

A data scientist is an individual who wrangles large swathes of data, both *unstructured* (e.g., images, videos, words) and *structured* (e.g., numeric data, or other quantitative forms such as dates). To do this, they not only leverage programming techniques, but consult statistical methods and processes such as machine-learning techniques to extract important insights from data not easily detectable my the human eye.

"Being a data scientist" is about not only leveraging cutting-edge statistical methods to inform others on a topic, scenario, or phenomenon, but to do so in an easy-to-digest fashion -- writing a report with the complexity of a dissertation, and then presenting it to a multi-million-dollar company's board will, most likely, *not* go over well! **Communication is key** in being a data scientist, and so often these individuals have some introductory skills in web programming (e.g., RShiny) to more easily inform their audience without having to rely on mathematical language.

In this vein, staying up-to-date on the industry in which these individuals work is incredibly important, as this helps them to stay relevant and be able to effectively communicate subjects of-interest with potential clients.

### Question 2: What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

The major duties of a data scientist include:

1.  **Data Wrangling** -- This duty involves the preprocessing, cleaning, and manipulation of large datasets. Typically, this duty requires an understanding of popular or necessary imputation methods (often, unstructured data include large `NULL` or `NA` values that need to be imputed with a default value or summary statistic, e.g. `mean()`).

2.  **Data Collection** -- Whether it be utilizing scraping tools/frameworks, physically recording data or retrieving data from machines or industry tools, or some other means of collection, *data collection* refers to the process of gathering data for analysis. For a data scientist, this will involve writing scripts or other programs to perform a series of operations, convert the returned data frames into a file format for easy/compact storage, and then appropriately store them for reading when necessary.

3.  **Analysis and Presentation** -- Instead of dividing these areas into multiple items, I combined them into one because **effective analysis on the part of a data scientist is hardly so, without digestable and memorable communication**. *Analysis* involves the utilization of statistical processes, packages, and techniques to extract valuable insights and construct [hopefully accurate] models from data. *Presentation* is the utilization of visualizations, whether they be plots, equations, or dataframes, to structure outputs from models in an easy-to-view fashion. Additionally, this may involve the utilization of web-programming frameworks to publish findings to be publicly available, if desired.

### Question 3: What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

Principal differences between data scientists and statisticians include:

1.  **Production System** -- *Data scientists* are usually very, very involved in the production of an analysis utilizing statistical models. This is because they work with both unstructured and structured data, where they often bring models to the data to understand and identify important relationships and behaviors between variables in datasets. *Statisticians* are less involved in the production of an analysis, often seeking to highlight or develop theoretical intutition by feeding data (whether synthetic or real) into a particular modeling framework, or designing and conducting a relevant experiment that can generate data. (Their models might be used by data scientists!) Additionally, this data may be less messy and more *cleaned* (by a data scientist!).

2.  **Motivation** -- *Statisticians* are focused on advancing methodology and science, and are typically research-oriented individuals. *Data scientsists*, whether contractually hired by a company to solve a problem or working *for* a company, are more result-oriented, in that they do not necessarily need to focus on the inner-workings of a statistical model, but rather utilize its functionality to address an issue or scenario.

Additionally, major similarities between the professions include:

1.  **Knowledge of Programming Languages** -- Typically, both professions utilize statistical programming languages (e.g., R, Python, SQL, SAS) to perform their duties, as by-hand calculations or derivations of models is... tedious.

2.  **Statistical Expertise** -- Neither of these professions lack statistical understanding; *statisticians* utilize this understanding to potentially develop new methodologies, while *data scientists*, though seldom presenting the mathematics behind statistical tools to clients, understand statistical methods and acutely know when to apply what test/procedure/model. *Additionally*, both professions are, by nature of many [under-]graduate curricula, trained in advanced mathematics and probability theory.

### Question 4: How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

I, myself, view my background as closer to a **data scientist** than to a **statistician**; I would have a much more difficult time developing statistical methodology and conducting experiments than I would applying relevant models to a particular scenario (based on coursework and internship experience).

As for career pursuits, however, I am not one to rule out either! Both these career fields are present in a vast array of industries and fields, and so, with proper background knowledge and training (and an interest for the field or work), I am sure that, by the conclusion of my graduate career, I can succeed as either!
